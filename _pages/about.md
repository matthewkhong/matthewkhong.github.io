Dr. Matthew K. Hong is a Senior Research Scientist on the Future Product Innovation team within the [Human-Centered AI](https://www.tri.global/our-work/human-centered-ai) division at Toyota Research Institute. Currently, he leads a team of behavioral scientists, ML and HCI researchers and explores the use of generative AI in amplifying human creativity for product design. He manages a portfolio of projects to innovate the conceptual design process, including augmenting design space exploration with semantics and analogical transfer, supporting visual style mixing with zero-shot interpolation, and developing interventions aimed at supporting professional creatives. 

Matthew's research has led to deployed technologies (e.g., [HAX Playbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/playbook/)) and publications in leading conference proceedings, including [ACM SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/), and a best paper award. Recently, his research on creativity and Human-AI interaction has been covered by [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/a-generative-ai-tool-to-inspire-creative-workers?utm_source=mitsloanlinkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=designAID) and the [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/efforts-make-text-ai-less-racist-terrible/).

He holds a Ph.D. in [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/academics/human-centered-computing-phd-program) from Georgia Tech, Master's in [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci) from Carnegie Mellon University, and a B.S. in [Cognitive Science](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/) from the University of California, San Diego.
