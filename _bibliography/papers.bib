  abstract={Supporting adolescent patient engagement in care is an important yet underexplored topic in consumer health informatics. Personal Health Records (PHRs) show potential, but designing PHR systems to accommodate both emerging adults and their parents is challenging. We conducted a mixed-methods study with teenage adolescent patients (ages 13-17) with cancer and blood disorders, and their parents, to investigate their experiences with My-Chart, a tethered PHR system. Through analyses of usage logs and independently-conducted surveys and interviews, we found that patients and parents both valued MyChart, but had different views about the role of the PHR for care communication and management, and different attitudes about its impact on the patient’s ability to manage care. Specific motivations for using MyChart included patient–parent coordination of care activities, communication around hospital encounters, and support for transitioning to adult care. Finally, some parents had concerns about certain diagnostic test results being made available to their children.},

  abstract={Adolescents with complex chronic illnesses, such as cancer and blood disorders, must partner with family and clinical caregivers to navigate risky procedures with life-altering implications, burdensome symptoms and lifelong treatments. Yet, there has been little investigation into how technology can support these partnerships. We conducted 38 in-depth interviews (15 with teenage adolescents with chronic forms of cancer and blood disorders, 15 with their parents, and eight with clinical caregivers) along with nine non-participant observations of clinical consultations, to better understand common challenges and needs that could be supported through design. Participants faced challenges primarily concerning: 1) teens' limited participation in their care, 2) communicating emotionally-sensitive information, and 3) managing physical and emotional responses. We draw on these findings to propose design goals for sociotechnical systems to support teens in partnering in their care, highlighting the need for design to support gradually-evolving partnerships.},

  abstract={Diagnostic radiology reports are increasingly being made available to patients and their family members. However, these reports are not typically comprehensible to lay recipients, impeding effective communication about report findings. In this paper, we present three studies informing the design of a prototype to foster patient-clinician communication about radiology report content. First, analysis of questions posted in online health forums helped us identify patients' information needs. Findings from an elicitation study with seven radiologists provided necessary domain knowledge to guide prototype design. Finally, a clinical field study with 14 pediatric patients, their parents and clinicians, revealed positive responses of each stakeholder when using the prototype to interact with and discuss the patient's current CT or MRI report and allowed us to distill three use cases: co-located communication, preparing for the consultation, and reviewing radiology data. We draw on our findings to discuss design considerations for supporting each of these use cases.},

  abstract={People use online search-and-discovery services, such as Yelp, by first finding a specific item with keywords and then examining the images linked to the item. Images could constitute an important part of users' decision-making process but users reach them indirectly. Although recently researchers proposed several image-based search interfaces, how they can effectively arrange huge number of images in a scalable manner is still not clear. To address this, we introduce PicNav, an image-driven navigation system that automatically arranges photos according to their semantic similarity. PicNav is built on deep neural networks learned from the Yelp food dataset and enables effective zoom-in/out features. We conducted interviews with ten users to qualitatively assess the system's usability. The users identified a number of advantages of PicNav, providing insights into the general use of imagery in search-and-discovery services.},

  abstract={During phases of treatment and between visits to the doctor’s office, adolescent patients with complex chronic illnesses must recognize and communicate about illness-related experiences with a variety of caregivers. However, significant gaps exist in our understanding of how to design appropriate techniques for eliciting day-to-day, illness- related observations from these patients. To address this gap, we draw on qualitative research on the needs of adolescents with complex chronic illnesses to propose a new, in situ approach to eliciting participatory design input, called “Just-in-Time Design.” Our approach draws inspiration from future breaching experiments and just-in-time intervention research, to both elicit adolescents’ momentary experiences and couple these with participatory design feedback. In this position paper we discuss our work-in-progress including how we are currently applying Just-in-Time Design to design new symptom-tracking tools for adolescents with cancer and chronic blood disorders.},

  abstract={Teens with complex chronic illnesses have difficulty understanding and articulating symptoms such as pain and emotional distress. Yet, symptom communication plays a central role in clinical care and illness management. To understand how design can help overcome these challenges, we created a visual library of 72 sketched illustrations, informed by the Observations of Daily Living framework along with insights from 11 clinician interviews. We utilized our library with storyboarding techniques, free-form sketching, and interviews, in co-design sessions with 13 pairs of chronically-ill teens and their parents. We found that teens depicted symptoms as being interwoven with narratives of personal and social identity. Teens and parents were enthusiastic about collaboratively-generated, interactive storyboards as a tracking and communication mechanism, and suggested three ways in which they could aid in communication and coordination with informal and formal caregivers. In this paper, we detail these findings, to guide the design of tools for symptom-tracking and incorporation of patient-generated data into pediatric care.},

  abstract={Patient-generated data, such as recorded Observations of Daily Living (ODL) and Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) data, are valued sources of information in oncology care. However, prior work largely focuses on capturing clinician-defined, patient-generated data in adult oncology care. Emerging research at the intersection of human–computer interaction and medical informatics suggests that visual narratives of patients' observations of daily living (Visual ODLs) could better support multi-party review of patients' everyday symptoms and quality of life, potentially improving patient–clinician communication. In this paper, we build on a prior study of Visual ODLs by describing a formative, two-phase study with 15 pediatric oncology clinicians. In Phase I, we analyzed data from ethnographic interviews in a pediatric oncology setting to capture the needs of nurses, nurse practitioners, and oncologists. In Phase II, we constructed two low-fidelity dashboard display prototypes, populated with Visual ODLs contributed by actual adolescent oncology patients, and we subsequently interviewed pediatric oncology clinicians who re-viewed each dashboard design. Findings from our study contribute four key design objectives for presenting interactive Visual ODL dashboards in pediatric oncology, along with three use cases for using these dashboards for symptom tracking and communication.},

  abstract={Research examining whether and how adolescent patients should gain access to their electronic health records is gaining momentum. We conducted a survey to explore diversity in adolescent privacy policies and identify common approaches in health information technology management for adolescent patients. Through descriptive analyses of survey data, we found a wide range of institutional policies regarding adolescent patient privacy, and large variations in health IT executives’ baseline knowledge of access policies. A majority of respondents agreed that formal guidelines pertaining to adolescent health record privacy would be helpful. Respondents suggested that these guidelines can be developed through the synthesis of multiple perspectives, including those of pediatricians, adolescent specialists, privacy experts, parents, patient advocates, and other professional entities.},

My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care, 2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families, and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.},

To explore how technology can support collaborative documentation of these experiences, we designed and distributed a paper diary probe kit in a two-week field deployment with 12 adolescent-parent dyads (24 participants). Three insights emerged from the study that highlight how technology can support shared illness management: 1) provide scaffolds to recognize physical and emotional experiences in the context of daily activities; 2) help families reconstruct patient experiences; and 3) adapt to individual preferences for capturing, representing and sharing experiences. We discuss opportunities for HCI research that follow from these findings and conclude by reflecting on the benefits and limitations of using diary probes with adolescent patients and their parental caregivers.},

In this work, we set out to support practitioners with early AI prototyping, with a focus on natural language (NL)-based technologies. Our interviews with 12 NL practitioners from a large technology company revealed that, in addition to challenges prototyping AI, prototyping was often not happening at all or focused only on idealized scenarios due to a lack of tools and tight timelines. These findings informed our design of the AI Playbook, an interactive and low-cost tool we developed to encourage proactive and systematic consideration of AI errors before deployment. Our evaluation of the AI Playbook demonstrates its potential to 1) encourage product teams to prioritize both ideal and failure scenarios, 2) standardize the articulation of AI failures from a user experience perspective, and 3) act as a boundary object between user experience designers, data scientists, and engineers.},

  abstract={Labeling short, unstructured texts is generally performed by sequentially identifying codes and assigning them to segments of text based on viewing a small sample of data. In this greedy approach, coders risk overlooking important code ideas and must perform the tedious task of iteratively revising the initial code set, and sometimes response code assignments, as new themes emerge. To address this, we propose CodeML, a machine learning-assisted (ML) coding interface that identifies multiple ideas in a response, which are displayed to support interactive data exploration, code identification, and refinement of snippet code assignments. By surfacing themes and snippets early, coders can consider a broader range of potential codes to reduce chances of omitting codes that surface later. A comparative study against search-style coding shows the potential for CodeML to facilitate initial exploration and discovery of finer-grained code sets while not adding significant cognitive load to organize codes and underlying text snippets.},
